# Food analysis

This repo contains a dataset of food items and their nutrition, as well as an
analysis of the nutrient content of the food. My goal was to try to find foods
that would allow me to relatively easily hit 100% of the recommended daily
intake for the wide variety of micronutrients one needs.
